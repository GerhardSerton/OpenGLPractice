OpenGL Prac

Use "make" to compile, "make run" to run, and "make clean" to clean. Please make sure to use the shaders provided by me in the "build" folder, as they have been modified specifically for this prac.

The provided "geometry" code cannot load anything other than vertexes, as one can see from the printout generated from the code. While this doesn't present a problem with the default used
"cube.obj", for more complex models this might pose an issue.

Once in the program, use the "up" and "down" keys to change the model's colour to red or blue, respectively.
"p" puts the program into rotate mode, "s" into scale mode, and "t" into translate mode. These transform the model with relation to the mouse pointer's current coordinates. As such, moving 
your cursor to the top-left hand portion of the screen will reset the model to it's "default" configuration in it's current mode.
